Task Selection Optimization: Using Heuristic Algorithms to Maximize Profit Under a 150K Budget.
In this project, I am working to maximize total profit by selecting tasks while ensuring that the total budget does not exceed 150K. I have implemented three algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Differential Evolution (DE). The highest value was achieved using the Genetic Algorithm, which selected 541 out of 1000 tasks and reached a value distribution of 5.5 million. However, PSO took the most time to compute.
